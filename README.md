# Automatic-review-analyzer

The objective of this project is to create a robust classifier for sentiment analysis on product reviews. Our training dataset comprises reviews from Amazon customers focusing on diverse toy products. Originally provided on a 5-point scale, the reviews have been transformed into a binary sentiment scale, with +1 indicating a positive review and -1 for a negative one. We implemented three algorithmsâ€”perceptron, average perceptron, and Pegasos. The algorithm that demonstrated superior performance was selected to construct the classifier, utilizing a word feature vector
